6. https daemon should also have support for user account creation from the app
7. make it so you can have 2 accounts udner 1 bastion account, switch between user id forwarded
8. Move shit to heap to avoid stack overflow
9. Server side "keep signed in", if sign in request is from same ip and < 30 or 60 days, approve without mobile approval
10. Everything goes int test, espcially cryptography
11. Spam filter, dont even send requests from random ip's. Use cloudflare too. If sus, ping phone in app but dont send push. Only push as notif if legit. Mark as weird if weird
12. Make sure to zero out any memory that previously held keys
13. Add threadsafe logger or mutex at least
14. Fix load issues

16. TODO Make sure auth token is stored hashed and enc with sym key on server side, super important
17. Check username isnt too long, some are null terminated in places, try and switch all to string. Also make username length max 2 less than bastion_username size
18. Prepend/Append unique id to usernames to help prevent accidental signins
